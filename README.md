# Simple linear regression

Simple Linear regressi√≥n is a mathematical model for finding the relationship between two variables, one independent and one dependent. This model help us to calculate predictions of the dependant variable when the independant one changes.

This is donde by fitting a linear equation and one of the method employed for adjusting it is the Least Squares Method. The equation is expressed as follows:
